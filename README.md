Uber Trips Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trips in New York City using Python. The analysis is based on a dataset of Uber pickups spanning various months, revealing patterns such as the busiest days, hours, and regions for Uber usage.

Dataset
The dataset contains approximately:
4.5 million Uber pickups from April to September 2014.
14.3 million Uber pickups from January to June 2015.

Columns in the dataset:
Date/Time: Timestamp of the pickup.
Lat: Latitude of the pickup location.
Lon: Longitude of the pickup location.
Base: Code affiliated with the Uber pickup.

Analysis Highlights
Key insights derived from the analysis:
Monday is the most profitable day for Uber.
Saturday has the lowest number of trips.
The busiest hour is 6 PM.
Uber trips start to rise after 5 AM.
Most trips originate near the Manhattan region.

Steps for Analysis:
Data Preparation: Extracted day, weekday, and hour from the Date/Time column.

Visualizations:
Daily trips using a histogram.
Hourly trips to identify peak hours.
Weekly trends highlighting weekend and weekday usage.
Heatmap to correlate hours and weekdays.
Density map to visualize trip distribution by location.

Conclusions:
Trips are highest on working days and decrease on weekends.
Trips start rising early in the morning and peak in the evening.

Summary:
This project provides insights into Uber trips in NYC, helping understand patterns in ridesharing services. Feel free to explore and modify the code for deeper insights or to adapt it for other datasets.
